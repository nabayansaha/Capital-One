## Abstract

The agriculture sector faces complex challenges including unpredictable weather patterns, crop diseases, fluctuating market prices, and rapidly changing government policies. Traditional decision-making processes often lack real-time data integration and intelligent analysis. KrishiMitra addresses these issues by providing an agentic AI solution that delivers weather-aware decision support, vision-enabled crop health monitoring, market intelligence, and simplified policy navigation through multiple accessible channels.

## Methodology

KrishiMitra consists of seven key components integrated through a multi-agent orchestration system:

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

- **Multi-Source Integration**: Weather APIs, Market Data feeds, Government Portals, Google Drive
- **Unified Pipeline**: OCR processing, chunking, embedding, and indexing
- **Drive Connector**: Secure document synchronization from Google Drive
- **Real-time Processing**: Continuous data updates and validation

### 2. The Parser

- Utilizes PyMuPDF (`fitz`) and OCR libraries (Tesseract) for document processing
- Handles multi-format documents (PDFs, images, spreadsheets)
- Extracts structured data from agricultural reports and research papers
- Preserves spatial relationships and tabular information

### 3. Intelligent Agent System

- **Weather Agent**: Meteorological insights, forecasts, and agricultural advisories
- **Crop Agent**: Disease detection, growth monitoring, and cultivation guidance
- **Market Agent**: Price trends, demand forecasts, and optimal selling recommendations
- **Policy Agent**: Government scheme interpretation and eligibility assessment
- **Financial Agent**: Economic analysis, profitability calculations, and investment advice
- **Generic Fallback Agent**: Handles unclassified queries and general agricultural questions

### 4. Context Builder & RAG System

- **Vector Database** (FAISS): Semantic search and context retrieval
- **Knowledge Graph**: Entity relationships and domain-specific knowledge modeling
- **Fact Checker**: Validates information accuracy using multiple sources
- **Context Enrichment**: Combines multi-modal data for comprehensive responses

### 5. Response Generation System

- **Agent Aggregator**: Coordinates multi-agent outputs for unified responses
- **Language Processing**: Translation and multilingual support
- **Output Formatting**: Adapts responses for text, voice, and visual interfaces
- **Confidence Scoring**: Implements fallback logic for low-confidence scenarios

### 6. Multi-Channel Interface

- **Web Application**: Interactive dashboard with visual tools and analytics
- **WhatsApp Bot**: Conversational AI for rural accessibility
- **Voice Interface**: Speech recognition and synthesis for hands-free operation
- **Field Marking UI**: GPS-enabled land demarcation and mapping tools

### 7. Continuous Learning Loop

- **Feedback Integration**: User feedback collection and analysis
- **Model Updates**: Adaptive learning based on user interactions
- **Performance Monitoring**: System optimization and accuracy improvements
- **Knowledge Base Expansion**: Continuous addition of agricultural insights
